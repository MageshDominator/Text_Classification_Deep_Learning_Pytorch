# Multi-Class_Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch
This repository contains various deep learning based multi-class text classification models applied on AG_news Dataset.<br /> It's more of a plug and play type. Designed in a way that you can customize these projects with little or no efforts on custom datasets.

## Various Architectures:
* [Designing our own Word Embedding + ANN](https://github.com/MageshDominator/Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch/blob/master/Text%20classification%20from%20scratch%20pytorch.ipynb)
* Pre-trained Embedding + Bi-LSTM + FC
* Pre-trained Embedding + Bi-LSTM with Attention networks

### To Do:
* Pre-Trained Embedding + Self-Attention
* Transformers
* CNN based Architectures
