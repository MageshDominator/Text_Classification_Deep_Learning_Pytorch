# Multi-Class_Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch
This repository contains various deep learning based multi-class text classification models applied on AG_news Dataset.<br /> It's more of a plug and play type. Designed in a way that you can customize these projects with little or no efforts on custom datasets.

## Various Architectures:
* [Designing our own Word Embedding + ANN](https://github.com/MageshDominator/Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch/blob/master/Text%20classification%20from%20scratch%20pytorch.ipynb): Creating word embeddings from scratch and Using a Fully connected layer on top of it for classification
* [Pre-trained Embedding + Bi-LSTM + FC](https://github.com/MageshDominator/Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch/blob/master/text%20classification%20with%20pre-trained%20embeddings%20and%20lstm.ipynb)
* [Pre-Trained Fast-Text Embedding + Bi-LSTM / ANN](https://github.com/MageshDominator/Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch/blob/master/text%20classification%20with%20fast-text%20embeddings%20and%20lstm.ipynb): Fast-Text Embeddings + A configurable architecture to either choose LSTM + FC or FC NN for classification 
* [Pre-trained Embedding + Bi-LSTM with Attention networks](https://github.com/MageshDominator/Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch/blob/master/text%20classification%20with%20pre-trained%20embeddings%2C%20lstm%2C%20attention.ipynb)
* [Pre-Trained Embedding + Self-Attention](https://github.com/MageshDominator/Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch/blob/master/text%20classification%20with%20pre-trained%20embeddings%2C%20self-attention.ipynb)
* [TextCNN](https://github.com/MageshDominator/Text_Classification_Deep_Learning_Pytorch/blob/master/text%20classification%20with%20CNN.ipynb)

### To Do:
* RCNN
* Character CNN
